#hello data science
Data science or Analytics (as it is popularly called) is being increasingly adopted by governments and enterprises. It is now as ubiquitous as PC or mobile applications. It is no more a matter of prediction that analytics is going to become pervasive to the extent that people will start using it for personal decisions. It is already happening around us.

I'm bitten by the analytics bug too! And this is my effort at the science.
